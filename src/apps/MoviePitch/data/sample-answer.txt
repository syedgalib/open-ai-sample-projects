In a world on the brink of destruction, one man's twisted obsession threatens to control the fate of all humanity. After years of isolation and self-imposed experiments, eccentric inventor Dr. Alexander Kane has created a powerful machine with the ability to control every human being on the planet. But when the machine unexpectedly malfunctions, causing chaos and enslaving the masses, it becomes clear that only those with true intelligence and the ability to think for themselves can resist its control. As society crumbles and the few remaining free humans struggle to survive, a ray of hope emerges in the form of highly intelligent animals. Led by a wise and fearless gorilla named Winston and a cunning and strategic fox named Luna, a group of animal rebels band together to take on Dr. Kane and his army of brainwashed followers.
